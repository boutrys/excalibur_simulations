# excalibur_simulations
Prioritization of genetic regions based on cohort (case vs control) using association testing

Preliminary test selection 
  - All the code used to perform the preliminary tests selection 
  - The folder results contains all the intermediate results from the preliminary selection steps

Numerical experiments and simulations design
  - Input data from COSI contains the data simulated via COSI program
  - Raw R results from simulations contains R data results for the 18 power experiments and 9 type I error experiments obtained thanks to the simulation pipeline
  - All the necessary functions to run the simulation pipeline (that can be launch via script_general_simulation.R

Excalibur.R is the function to use our proposed optimal ensemble method based on a combination of 33 aggregation tests
